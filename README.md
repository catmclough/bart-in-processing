# bart-in-processing
As my 'Hello World' project in Craig Kapp's Interactive Computing Class at NYU (Fall 2014), I made a sketch of Bart Simpson using vector graphics. To create this simple interactive sketch I had to learn the basics of sketching in Processing, how to draw shapes on a canvas, and click-event handling. When you click on the sketch of Bart, words appear like magic!
